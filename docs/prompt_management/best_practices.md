# Prompt Engineering Best Practices

This guide outlines best practices for creating effective prompt templates in the BlueAbel AIOS Multi-Component Prompting (MCP) framework.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Write prompts that are clear and direct rather than clever or complex.
2. **Specificity Matters**: Be specific about the task, format, and expectations.
3. **Structure for Success**: Use consistent structure to guide the model's output.
4. **Test and Iterate**: Continuously test and refine your prompts based on results.
5. **Context is Key**: Provide sufficient context for the model to understand the task.

## Template Structure

A well-structured prompt template typically includes:

1. **Role Definition**: Define the role the model should assume.
2. **Task Specification**: Clearly state the task to be performed.
3. **Context Provision**: Provide necessary context or information.
4. **Output Format**: Specify the expected format for the response.
5. **Examples**: Where helpful, include examples of expected outputs.

### Example Structure

```
You are a [ROLE], tasked with [TASK].

Context:
{context}

Instructions:
1. [First instruction]
2. [Second instruction]
3. [Third instruction]

Respond in the following format:
[OUTPUT FORMAT SPECIFICATION]
```

## Input Variables

- **Required vs. Optional**: Clearly distinguish between required and optional inputs.
- **Sensible Defaults**: For optional inputs, consider providing default values or clear guidance.
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive variable names that indicate their purpose.
- **Input Validation**: Include guidance on how to handle invalid or unexpected inputs.

### Example Input Usage

```
Article to summarize:
{text}

Desired length: {length:optional}

Focus areas: {focus_areas:optional}

Summary:
```

## Common Patterns

### For Summarization

```
You are a summarization expert. Your task is to create a concise summary of the following content.

Content to summarize:
{text}

Length: {length:optional}

Summary:
```

### For Analysis

```
You are analyzing {analysis_type} content. Extract key insights, patterns, and implications.

Content to analyze:
{text}

Analysis:
```

### For Classification

```
You are a classifier for {category_type}. Categorize the following content according to these categories: {categories}.

Content to classify:
{text}

Classification result:
```

### For Extraction

```
Extract the following entities from the provided text: {entity_types}.

Text to process:
{text}

Extracted entities:
```

### For Generation

```
Generate {output_type} based on the following requirements:

Topic: {topic}
Style: {style:optional}
Length: {length:optional}
Requirements: {requirements:optional}

Generated {output_type}:
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting

For complex reasoning tasks, guide the model through a step-by-step thinking process:

```
You are solving a complex problem. Think through this step-by-step.

Problem:
{problem}

Step 1: Identify the key elements of the problem.
Step 2: Determine the relationships between these elements.
Step 3: Apply relevant principles or formulas.
Step 4: Calculate the solution.
Step 5: Verify your answer.

```

### Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to guide the model's understanding of the task:

```
Your task is to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.

Example 1:
Feedback: "The product was delivered on time and works perfectly."
Classification: Positive

Example 2:
Feedback: "I waited three weeks and the item arrived damaged."
Classification: Negative

Example 3:
Feedback: "The item matched the description. Delivery took one week."
Classification: Neutral

New feedback: {feedback}

Classification:
```

### Format Control

Strictly control the output format when needed:

```
Extract the following information from the text and format it as valid JSON.

Text:
{text}

Required fields:
- name: The person's full name
- age: Their age as a number
- occupation: Their job title
- location: Their city and country

JSON output:
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague Instructions**: Avoid ambiguous language that could be interpreted in multiple ways.
2. **Overly Complex Prompts**: Simplicity often yields better results than complexity.
3. **Insufficient Context**: Provide enough information for the model to complete the task effectively.
4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout your templates.
5. **Missing Input Validation**: Account for potential edge cases in user inputs.
6. **Neglecting Testing**: Always test prompts with various inputs to ensure robustness.
7. **Contradictory Instructions**: Ensure all parts of your prompt are aligned and not contradictory.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Baseline Testing**: Start with a simple version of your prompt to establish a baseline.
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with edge cases, minimal inputs, and unexpected values.
3. **Comparative Testing**: Compare different versions of prompts side by side.
4. **User Testing**: Get feedback from users on the effectiveness of the prompt.
5. **Iteration**: Continuously improve based on testing results.

## Version Control Best Practices

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to track changes.
2. **Meaningful Commits**: Add descriptive messages when updating components.
3. **Document Changes**: Keep a record of what changed and why for significant updates.
4. **Test Before Deployment**: Always test changes before deploying to production.
5. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: When possible, maintain compatibility with existing systems.

## BlueAbel AIOS MCP-Specific Guidelines

1. **Component Specialization**: Create focused components that do one thing well.
2. **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different contexts.
3. **Documentation**: Document inputs, expected outputs, and usage examples.
4. **Failure Handling**: Consider how your prompt should handle unexpected inputs or failures.
5. **Performance Considerations**: Be mindful of token usage in your prompts.

## Examples of Effective Prompts

### Effective Content Summary

```
You are a content summarization expert. Create a concise summary that captures the main points and key information from the following content.

Focus on:
- Core arguments and primary takeaways
- Key facts and data points
- Essential context and background

Content to summarize:
{text}

Desired length: {length:optional}

Summary:
```

### Effective Entity Extraction

```
Extract entities from the following text. For each entity type, list all instances found.

Entity types to extract:
- People (names of individuals)
- Organizations (companies, institutions, agencies)
- Locations (countries, cities, places)
- Dates (any date or time references)
- Products (goods, services, or offerings)

Text to analyze:
{text}

Extracted entities (formatted as JSON):
```
