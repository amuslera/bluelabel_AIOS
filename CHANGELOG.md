## Known Issues

1. **Flask UI API Integration**:
   - Flask UI is using mock data instead of real API integration
   - Current implementation has commented-out API calls that need to be enabled
   - Testing with real data flow is required

2. **LLM Processing Timeout**:
   - The system hangs when processing content with LLM integration
   - Likely caused by connection issues with Ollama or timeout configuration
   - Current workaround: Use test agent to bypass LLM processing

3. **Server Management**:
   - Port conflicts between restarts
   - Difficult to manage server processes
   - Manual intervention often required

4. **UI Responsiveness**:
   - Long-running tasks block UI
   - Limited feedback during processing
   - No progress indicators
