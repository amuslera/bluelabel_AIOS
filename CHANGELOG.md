---

### v0.5.0 - Knowledge Repository (commit: c0d09ed)
**Date**: May 9, 2025

**Features**:
- PDF processor with metadata extraction
- Audio processor with Whisper transcription
- Vector database integration with ChromaDB
- Knowledge repository with SQLAlchemy
- Enhanced UI with improved content display
- Test agent for debugging without LLM dependency

**Status**: Functional knowledge management system with multi-format content support.

**Issues**:
- LLM timeout when processing content
- Server management issues (port conflicts)
- Parameter inconsistencies between layers

**Next Steps**:
1. **Debugging LLM Integration**:
   - Add proper timeout handling in LLM requests
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when LLM is unavailable
   - Add better error reporting in the UI

2. **Server Management**:
   - Configure proper process management to avoid port conflicts
   - Add graceful shutdown and restart capabilities
   - Consider containerization for more consistent deployment

3. **Add Social Media Processor**:
   - Implement Twitter/X content extraction
   - Add LinkedIn post processing
   - Create unified social media interface

---

### v0.6.0 - Multi-Component Prompting Framework
**Date**: May 11, 2025

**Features**:
- Comprehensive Multi-Component Prompting (MCP) framework
- Reusable prompt components with versioning and history tracking
- Component registry for centralized prompt management
- Template validation and rendering with variable substitution
- FastAPI endpoints for component CRUD operations
- Streamlit UI for component editing and management
- Integration with ModelRouter for dynamic prompt selection
- Component testing framework for LLM evaluation
- Agent integration with task-specific prompt components

**Status**: Advanced prompt management system with component versioning and reuse.

**Issues**:
- Need to create more domain-specific components
- Limited component composition (no components within components yet)
- Missing component performance metrics and analytics

**Next Steps**:
1. **Component Library Expansion**:
   - Create specialized components for different domains
   - Add content-type specific components
   - Develop structured output components for consistent formatting

2. **Component Composition**:
   - Enable component nesting and referencing
   - Implement inheritance and extension mechanisms
   - Add template fragment reuse across components

3. **Component Analytics**:
   - Track component usage and performance metrics
   - Add visualization of component relationships
   - Create test comparison and optimization tools

## Current Development Status

The system currently provides:
- Content processing for URLs, PDFs, audio, and text
- Knowledge repository with vector search capabilities
- Tag and entity extraction and management
- Multi-format content browsing and search
- Hybrid LLM integration (local and cloud)
- Multi-Component Prompting framework for versioned templates

Key architectural components:
- Agent framework for modular content processing
- Vector database for semantic search
- Structured storage for content relationships
- Model router for intelligent LLM selection
- Component registry for prompt management
- Versioning system for prompt history tracking

## Known Issues

1. **LLM Processing Timeout**:
   - The system hangs when processing content with LLM integration
   - Likely caused by connection issues with Ollama or timeout configuration
   - Current workaround: Use test agent to bypass LLM processing

2. **Server Management**:
   - Port conflicts between restarts
   - Difficult to manage server processes
   - Manual intervention often required

3. **UI Responsiveness**:
   - Long-running tasks block UI
   - Limited feedback during processing
   - No progress indicators

## Planned Features

### Near Term (Next Release)
- Fix LLM timeout issues
- Add proper error handling and recovery
- Implement social media content processor
- Enhance UI with progress indicators

### Medium Term
- Add background processing for long-running tasks
- Implement user authentication and profiles
- Create content analytics dashboard
- Add export capabilities (PDF, Markdown, etc.)

### Long Term
- Develop automated research capabilities
- Implement collaboration features
- Create knowledge graph visualization
- Add integration with productivity tools
